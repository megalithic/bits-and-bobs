# Google Music Hotkeys

Alfred 2.0 workflows and Applescripts to control Google Play Music

By [Steven La](www.stevenla.com)


## Alfred 2.0

I've set the default hotkeys to F7, F8, and F9 for previous, play/pause, and
next track like on my Macbook. Use [KeyRemap4MacBook][] to remap the media
keys to the F-keys.

Requires the [Alfred Powerpack][]!

## Command Line (Applescript)

Comes with Google Chrome and Safari variants. Both have the same syntax, just
different files.

**Usage:** `./chrome.applescript ACTION` or `./safari.applescript ACTION`

**Actions:** `playPause`, `prevSong`, `nextSong`, `toggleShuffle`,
`toggleRepeat`. A full list of actions is availible from [this gist][]
