El Capitan System Font Replacement
================================
Version 1.2

This special Input Sans font package is designed to replace the Helvetica-based system font on Mac OS 10.11 El Capitan. 

PLEASE NOTE: The Input system font replacements were originally intended as a fun alternative to Helvetica. Now that Apple has introduced the San Francisco font, I may not offer continued support for this hack in El Capitan and future versions of Mac OS.

## Install

Place the font files in your /Library/Fonts folder (the one inside your root directory). Log out and log back in for all changes to take effect.

## Uninstall

To uninstall, simply remove the files from the /Library/Fonts folder. Log out and in again for all changes to take effect.

## More Info

These special fonts contain metadata that allow them to masquerade as the system font family, and will not install like normal fonts. This is a nondestructive process: You can override the default font without modifying system files or configuration. Simply remove these font files and everything goes back to normal. This approach was inspired by Jens Kutílek’s Fira System Font Replacement.

Additionally, the stem weights, letterspacing, and other design elements have been tweaked to make these fonts more suitable for use in this interface.
