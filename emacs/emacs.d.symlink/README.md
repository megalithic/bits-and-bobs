# An attempt at converting to emacs

Thanks to this inspiring [video from Chris
McCord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wAeFiGv_yE) I decided to take his
experiences of moving from [vim to emacs](https://github.com/chrismccord/dot_emacs) as a starting point.

All configuration is located in `init.el`, should be easy to customize, and has been tailored for a vim user who wants the best of both worlds.
